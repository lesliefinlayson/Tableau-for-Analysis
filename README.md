# Citibike Bike Sharing Trip Analysis

## Background and Purpose of the Analysis

A bike sharing program is a shared transport service niwhich bicyles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or fee.  Users typically check out a bike using a membership or credit/debit card.  They can then ride to their destination and park the bike at a nearby docking station. The benefits of these programs include transport flexibility, reduction of vehicle emissions, health benefits, reduced congestion and fuel consumption, and financial savings for individuals.  At a community level, bike sharing is recognized as a means to attract or retain residents, students and workforce talent. Bike sharing serves visitors and is a unique way to experience a city, helping attract their spending power.   Local businesses and employers see benefits by experiencing increased economic activity in commercial areas surrounding bike share stations. 

To further determine if a bike sharing program is a feasible investment in Des Moines, this analysis explores New York City's Citi Bike data to reveal trends in bike sharing use.

#### _Graph 1:  Checkout Times by Users_

Data shows that between 4 and 6 hours are the most popular length for bike checkouts.  The peak time duration for bike checkout is at 5 hours with 173,712 users.  

#### _Graph 2:  Checkout Times by Usertypes_

On further breaking down graph 1 from general "users" to the subcategories "usertypes", can see that the majority of the participants of the bike share program are subscribers.

#### _Graph 3:  Checkout Times by Gender_

<img width="673" alt="2021-09-25 (7)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84471904/134785805-4bd652c7-b31a-41e1-ac6e-def34882b39d.png">

The Citi Bike data was broken out by gender to see if there are differing trends.  The data shows a higher number of males are using the bike share program.

#### _Graph 4:  Trips by Weekday per Hour_

<img width="311" alt="2021-09-25 (9)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84471904/134785932-17997cfe-e0e8-4ede-bd8d-5969875a404a.png">

This heat map shows that the busiest hours for bike share trips are commuting hours on the weekdays, 8 am and 5 to 6 pm showing highest use (indicated by darkest color).  As to be expected, the least amount of use (shown by the lightest colors) are in the early am hours.  In addition, the weekends show moderately high use mid day through evening.  
#### _Graph 5:  Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)_

<img width="719" alt="2021-09-25 (13)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84471904/134788078-d37a3a30-e0ed-4c83-81ae-5dd745c2c67e.png">

Exploring the data in Graph 4 further, trips by weekday per hour was explored by gender.  While both female and male use of the bike share program is conistent with the earlier findings, use is highest during commuting hours and moderately high on the weekends, the gradient of use is more extreme in the male category, as shown by the stronger contrast in graph colors.  

#### _Graph 6:  User Trips by Gender and Usertype by Weekday_

<img width="668" alt="2021-09-25 (11)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84471904/134786187-4c613c65-913b-4c24-9db7-ed30aa1048e7.png">

Breaking down the data further in this graph, the customer usertype is fairly consistent for all days of the week, with slightly higher use on the weekends.  The subscriber category shows again that males have the highest number of trips (indicated by the darker colors).  For both male and female categories, Thursday shows highest use.  

#### _Graph 7:  Trip Starting Locations by Use and Gender_

<img width="711" alt="2021-09-25 (15)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84471904/134788109-c8afcfae-83a0-463f-a1b9-e7dbe86e219f.png">

In this graph, the larger the marker the more use the bike station receives.  This graph shows that the highest used bike stations for the start of a trip are in the more developed and populated areas of New York City, such as Union Square.

There is no obvious difference in bike station preference based on gender.   

#### _Graph 8:  Trip Ending Locations by Use and Gender_
